# Reach.js

Currently a proof-of-concept.

A really tiny UI ~~framework~~ library. Reach.js is a pure Typescript library that enables atomic design centred on HTML and CSS. Reach.js works with HTML and CSS as part of it's components, enabling seperation of concerns without render functions, templates or additional compilers.

[Currently debugging by doing](https://bm13563.github.io/Reach.js/). This is the rendered content of the [src/website directory](https://github.com/bm13563/Reach.js/tree/main/src/website).
